illucia is a patchbay USB controller/console developed by Chris Novello with Processing and Arduino to be 100% open source 
(in terms of hardware and software--only about 20 units were produced, but anyone is free to reproduce the machine--schematics and 
code are up on GitHub). Using patch cables and jacks (as well as replaceable knobs, buttons, switches, joysticks, etc.), 
illucia allows users to interconnect various kinds of software (videogames, synthesizers, word processors etc.) in novel ways by 
in effect "playing" an OSC network. The machine comes with a suite of interconnectable programs: PCO is modeled on Breakout, 
Life Sequencer on Tetris; Stand Stijl and Paper Cup are artistic text editors; Pointl and War Machine take after paint & image programs. 
Letting these programs speak to each other allows users to, as Novello says, "make drum machines play word processors, remix music 
using paint programs" etc. live and in real-time--illucia's Arduino (and Processing) base and ability to be used with other controllers 
(Novello demonstrates playing/hacking/remixing Super Mario Bros. with a Soundplane) suggests a new and exciting mode of performing 
gameplay as if the player were an electronic musician.
